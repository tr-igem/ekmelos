The Ekmelos Font
================

Ekmelos is a music font compliant with [SMuFL](http://www.smufl.org/ "Standard Music Font Layout").
It includes over 3000 glyphs - clefs, noteheads, accidentals,
articulations, ornaments, playing techniques, etc.
The focus is on the numerous accidentals for microtonal music,
particularly for use along with [Ekmelily](https://github.com/tr-igem/ekmelily)
which initiated the development of Ekmelos.

The Ekmelos Font Software is a family consisting of four fonts:

*   Ekmelos
*   Ekmelos 12-EDO
*   Ekmelos 24-EDO
*   Ekmelos 72-EDO

Each is available as OpenType, WOFF, WOFF2, and SVG.
The first font is also available as [UFO3](https://unifiedfontobject.org/).
The other fonts include mainly accidentals for the respective EDO,
intended for use on Web pages (e.g. with [ekmelib](http://www.ekmelic-music.org/en/extra/ekmelib.htm))
reducing the download volume.
